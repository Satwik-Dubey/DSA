Intuition and Logic Behind the Merge Algorithm
Core Intuition
The key insight is to merge backwards (from the end of the arrays) rather than forwards. This approach is clever because:

No Extra Space Needed: Since we're filling the merged array from the end, we don't overwrite any elements in array A that we haven't processed yet

Natural Order Preservation: By always picking the larger remaining element, we ensure correct ordering without complex shuffling

Why It Works
Visualizing the Problem
Imagine two sorted piles of cards (A and B) and an empty space at the end of pile A big enough to hold all cards. Instead of trying to insert from the front (which would require shifting elements), we:

Look at the bottom card of each pile

Take the larger one and place it at the very end of the empty space

Repeat until one pile is empty

If pile B still has cards, place them in order

Logical Steps
Pointer Initialization:

i points to the last real element in A

j points to the last element in B

idx points to the last position of the merged array

Comparison Loop:

Compare A[i] and B[j]

Place the larger value at A[idx]

Move both the value's pointer and idx backwards

This ensures we're always placing the next-largest element in the correct spot

Remaining Elements:

If B is exhausted first, the remaining A elements are already in place

If A is exhausted first, we copy the remaining B elements

Why Forward Merging Doesn't Work
If we tried merging from the start:

We'd need temporary storage to avoid overwriting elements in A

Or we'd have to shift elements, making the algorithm O(nÂ²) in worst case

Time Complexity Analysis
O(m+n) time: Each element is examined exactly once

O(1) space: No additional storage needed beyond the input arrays

This is optimal for merging two sorted arrays when one has enough space for the result.
